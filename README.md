# Ecommerce Frontend

This is the frontend application for the Ecommerce project, built with **Vue.js**.  
It connects with a backend API to provide features like OTP login, browsing products, cart management, and more.

## Live Routes

- **/** → Home page  
- **/login** → Login page (OTP-based login)


## Note

- This is not the complete built and functional, this broject can be considered as a building blocck (project setup).
- It consists of two files one is fully functional login page, and the other is home page.
- The login page functions as i wanted it to be, but i home page needs lots and lots of update, its not functional, many buttons don't even work.
- It will take time for me tofix this page.
- All the backend routes are mentioned in the API documentation of the backedn project.
- If you are willing to contribute to thi project or build the frontend you are welcome, you can reffer my ecommerece-backend and the API's.
